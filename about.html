      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>I’m a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Alberta
		  with a strong passion for design, innovation, and problem-solving.
		  Growing up I always had an interest in designing things, whether it be drawing, 
	  modeling, or building things out of lego, I could never get enough of it. 
	  I decided to pursue an engineering degree so that I can take my love of creativity, and my love for math,
		to the professional level. </p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>My hobbies are drawing, pottery, and playing musical instruments. I play 7 instruments: Harp, Piano, Flute, Ukulele, Guitar, Piccolo, and I sing. 
	  I've always enjoyed designing and creating and my dream is to combine that passion with engineering work. You might have noticed on the home page some of the 
	  images were a little odd to include, but I included them because they're drawings that I made. I also made this image below. </p>
